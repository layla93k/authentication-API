# Authentication-API

This API, built using TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB, serves as a practice project to enhance my TypeScript skills and familiarise myself with non-relational databases. I used MongoDB as I only required a small non-relational database to hold the user schema. It includes endpoints for user registration, login, deletion (restricted to the logged-in user), user profile editing (restricted to the logged-in user), and fetching a list of all users (accessible only when logged in).
